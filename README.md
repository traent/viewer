>Improve your data storytelling with interactive and beautiful visuals that leverage authentic data from your blockchains. Use the Viewer to explore ledgers directly in your browser. Stop relying on data from untrusted servers.

</br>

Traent Viewer allows everyone to open, browse and audit the [ledgers](https://traent.com/guides/ledgers-settings/) of [Traent Era](https://traent.com/guides/era/). 
Now, Viewerâ€™s source code becomes open to everyone. Thanks to the Viewer, and without any other intermediaries, it is possible to open and preview documents, list streams, and read threads contained in any exported Traent Era project. Furthermore, the Ledger Explorer provides access to proofs of notarization, to each block contained in the ledger, and to in-chain and off-chain keys, allowing all to verify the integrity of the ledger data.

### Streams
[Streams](https://traent.com/guides/?page_id=340) allow you to connect any data source within an Era project. Data can be entered by the users or provided in real-time by IoT devices or any third-party APIs.
Since IoT data are instantly stored in the ledger, it automatically updates all the documents where they are referenced.

![Streams](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74921617/205900108-ee2fc20b-30f2-4828-92b3-9d7e4f05a33b.png)

### Threads
[Threads](https://traent.com/guides/?page_id=354) allow participants of an Era project to discuss together.  This tool can be also used to send smart links (to other threads, documents, and streams of the project) straightforwardly. 

![Threads](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74921617/205900218-c33b837d-616d-450d-9599-c0b479d6c82c.png)


## Ledger Explorer
The [Explorer](https://traent.com/guides/?page_id=402) is an advanced tool to go deep-down in the ledger content, allowing anyone to check the notarization status of the ledger, the proofs, in-chain and off-chain keys, and all the blocks contained in it.
